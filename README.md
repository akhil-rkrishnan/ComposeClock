# Compose Clock

Compose Clock is a user-friendly analog clock application crafted with Jetpack Compose, Google's innovative UI toolkit for developing native Android applications. It serves as an illustrative guide on integrating custom user interfaces through the utilization of paths and arcs within the Compose Canvas framework.

### About

The Compose Clock app ingeniously displays time in the 12-hour format, showcasing hours ranging from 1 to 12 on its analog interface. Leveraging foundational trigonometric principles, the clock meticulously renders its components, including the clock face and hands. This approach not only delivers a visually appealing user experience but also provides a valuable learning opportunity for developers interested in mastering custom UI implementation with Jetpack Compose.
